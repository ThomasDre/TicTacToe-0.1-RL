This is a simple implementation TicTacToe Environment. The environment is subclassing the OpenAI's Gym Environments ecosystem. Thus this environement can be used as usual by following the standard approach initializing any Gym enviornment.

Running example:

import gym
import gym-tictactoe
env = gym.make('custom-tictactoe')
